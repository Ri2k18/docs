# Getting started

Get started with Chainstack in a few steps, and experience the ease of deploying a node on a protocol and cloud of your choice.

## Sign up

First things first, head to [Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com), and sign up.

![Sign up](./getting-started/sign-up.png)

Since this is your first time, you won't see any project. So let's start creating a project, and, even before that, understand why you need one.

![Empty projects page](./getting-started/empty-projects-page.png)

On Chainstack, a project contains one or more blockchain networks related to a clearly defined business case. Creating a project is a prerequisite to creating or joining a blockchain network.

For example, an organization may have development and production blockchain networks related to a single business case such as tracking of auto parts. In such a case, we recommend organizing both blockchain networks under one project called **Parts-Tracking**.

There are two types of projects:
- In a [consortium](/projects/consortium) project, multiple organizations can operate consortium networks based on [MultiChain](/blockchains/multichain) or [Quorum](/blockchains/quorum) protocols
- In a [public chain](/projects/public-chain) project, your organization can operate public Ethereum nodes

## Create a consortium

Let's create a consortium project by clicking _Create Project_ and choosing the _Consortium_ option from under the _Project type_ drop-down. Enter **Parts-Tracking** and **Auto parts tracking blockchain network with consortium members** into _Name_ and _Description_ fields respectively, and click _Create_.

![Successful project creation](./getting-started/consortium/successful-project-creation.png)

You have just created your first consortium project, but it means nothing unless you have invited another member organization to collaborate with you and launched a blockchain node. Let's continue.

### Invite a member

If you are simply tinkering with the platform and don't have a member yet to invite to your newly created consortium, you can skip to the next step.

If not, click the newly created project card, click _Member_, and then _Invite member_. Enter the email address of the organization representative, who will collaborate with you on the **Parts-Tracking** project, and click _Send_. This triggers an email invite to the recipient. Once accepted, the recipient will be listed in your members list. For now though, you will see an _Invitation sent_ status to the invited member.

![Member invited](./getting-started/consortium/member-invited.png)

### Create a network

So you have created a project, **Parts-Tracking** in our case, and, perhaps, invited a member or two in the previous step. To create a network, click _Create Network_. The _Create Network_ wizard opens in a modal.

For starters, let's assume you want to test a MultiChain blockchain network. Enter the following network name: **dev-multichain-parts-tracking**. Select _MultiChain_ from the _Blockchain protocol_ drop-down. Consensus mechanisms applicable to the protocol will be displayed below.

In the case of MultiChain, there is no need to choose any consensus protocol. Chainstack automatically selects the default one, which is, _Round-robin_. If you were to choose Quorum, however, _Raft_ and _IBFT_ would have been displayed. Not sure which one to choose? Chainstack provides a helpful link _Help me to choose_ that takes you to an extensive guide in our documentation.

### Deploy nodes

Coming back to our MultiChain network, click _Next_ to view _Nodes deployment_. Chainstack automatically creates a default node, which you can view and rename. But we are jumping the gun here. Since a node has already been created in the background, all we need to do is to specify whether the node should be deployed on the cloud or in a hybrid environment. If cloud, specify the cloud provider.

Let's select _Cloud_ and _Google Cloud Platform_ from under the _Deployment options_ and _Cloud hosting provider_ sections as well as the specific _Region_.

![Create network > nodes deployment](./getting-started/consortium/create-network-nodes-deployment.png)

Click _Next_ to review your network and node details. If there are no changes, click _Create Network_.

![Create network > summary](./getting-started/consortium/create-network-summary.png)

This takes you back to the **Parts-Tracking** project page with all its networks. At the moment, we can see the first network **dev-multichain-parts-tracking**. Your first blockchain node will display a _Running_ status. Once the node status changes to _Running_, you can click it to view the node details.

![Network created](./getting-started/consortium/network-created.png)

Congratulations! You successfully created a MultiChain network with a single node and, perhaps, already set the stage for collaboration by inviting a member. Either way, all it took was a few minutes.

## Run a public blockchain node

Create a public chain project by clicking _Create Project_ and choosing the _Public chain_ option from under the _Project type_ drop-down. Enter **Data Sharing Application** and **Decentralized app on Ethereum for data sharing / single source of truth among participants** into _Name_ and _Description_ fields respectively, and click _Create_. You have just created your first public chain project. 

![Successful project creation](./getting-started/public-chain/project-created.png)

### Join a network

But this is just a beginning. To join a public chain network, Ethereum, in this case, click the project listing to view the _Join network_ modal. 

Select _Ethereum_ from _Blockchain protocol_. Network options available under the specific blockchain protocol are visible under _Blockchain network_. Select _Mainnet_.

![Join network](./getting-started/public-chain/join-network.png)

Click _Next_ to view the _Nodes deployment_ section.

### Deploy nodes

On the _Nodes Deployment_ screen, select the _Node type_. You can learn more about _Shared_ or _Dedicated_ nodes by clicking _Help me to choose_. Select your _Cloud hosting provider_ and _Region_.

![Node deployment](./getting-started/public-chain/node-deployment.png)

Click _Next_ to view the _Summary_ section. Review the information, and click _Join network_.

![Summary](./getting-started/public-chain/summary.png)

That's it. It will take a few minutes, but once the node _Status_ changes from _Pending_ to _Running_, it's an indication that you have joined the Ethereum network.

![Network joined](./getting-started/public-chain/network-joined.png)

Click the _Node name_ to view its details. This is where you will find the credentials required to interact with the node and build your first decentralized application.

![Node details](./getting-started/public-chain/node-details.png)

## Next steps

Now it's the most fun part! Start [interacting with the blockchain](/guides/interacting-with-the-blockchain) and [developing the applications](/guides/application-development) using the node credentials obtained.
