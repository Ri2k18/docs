# View node and network status

You can view the node and network status in the **Status** column of your nodes list or your networks list.

| Node status | Network status |
|-------------|----------------|
| Running     | Running        |
| Maintenance | Running        |
| Failed      | Error          |

* Running — the network is running.
* Maintenance — the node is in the maintenance mode and will be back online shortly.
* Failed — the node has failed.
* Error — the network has at least one failed node.

In the unlikely case that a node enters a failed state, there is no action required on your part as the Chainstack team will be immediately alerted and resolve the issue.
