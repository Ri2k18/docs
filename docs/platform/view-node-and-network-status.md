# View node and network status

You can view the node and network status in the **Status** column of your nodes list or your networks list.

| Node status | Network status | Description                              |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Running     | Running        | All network nodes are running.           |
| Maintenance | Running        | The node is in maintenance mode.         |
| Failed      | Error          | The node has failed to deploy.           |
| Error       | Error          | The node is deployed but malfunctioning. |

In the unlikely case that a node enters a failed state or an error state, there is no action required on your part as the Chainstack team will be immediately alerted and resolve the issue.
